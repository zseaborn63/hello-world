# hello-world
===============================
Greetings peoples,
Be proud, this is my first repository.
I'm about to start class at The Iron Yard in Greenville, SC for Python Engineering and Data Science.  I had to get a GitHub account to enroll there, which I'm glad I did now.

I'm a cook who wants to be a programmer.
